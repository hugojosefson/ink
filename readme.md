# ink for deno

An attempt at making ink work with [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## TODO

### 1. Proof of concept

This PoC is for seeing how some basic functionality from `ink` can be made to work with
Deno.

- [x] Strip `ink` of everything but the code.
- [x] `deno fmt`
- [â€¦] Make the syntax pass `./check-syntax`.
    - [ ] If necessary, fork dependencies and make them work with Deno.
    - [ ] If necessary, remove dependencies that are not needed if they cause any
      trouble.
- [ ] ????
- [ ] Hopefully, get some basic `ink` functionality running with Deno.

### 2. Contribute

- [ ] Evaluate if/how relevant parts of the PoC can be implemented properly
      upstream.
